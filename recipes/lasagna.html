    <h3>Delicious Lasagna Recipe</h3>
    <p>This simple lasagna is perfect for when you're short on time, but craving a comforting meal. 
        Ready in just over an hour, it requires only 50 minutes of cooking in the oven.Extra-lean ground beef 
        (which sometimes cooks up dry) works well here because it's combined with marinara to keep it moist. 
        For a quick and easy variation, feel free to use 9 whole lasagna noodles instead of 6 broken noodles, 
        using 3 noodles per layer. You also can sub fresh basil leaves for the parsley sprinkled on at the end.

Arrange 2 long noodles along outside edges of dish; arrange 4 short noodle pieces along center of dish.</li>
        <li>Top noodles with 1 cup meat sauce. Top with 2 long noodles and 4 short noodle pieces, all of ricotta mixture, and 1 cup meat sauce.
